description: Diff::LCS is a port of Algorithm::Diff that uses the McIlroy-Hunt longest
  common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to compute intelligent differences between two
  sequenced enumerable containers. The implementation is based on Mario I. Wolczko's
  Smalltalk version (1.2, 1993) and Ned Konz's Perl version (Algorithm::Diff).
